        "1) What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A parameter is a value inside a model that is learned from the data during training (e.g., weights in linear regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "5) How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Lower loss value means the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values, indicating better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Continuous variables: Numeric values with infinite possibilities (e.g., height).\n",
        "-> Categorical variables: Non-numeric labels or categories (e.g., gender).\n",
        "\n",
        "7) How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> By converting categories into numeric form.\n",
        "Common techniques: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Target Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Training: Used to teach the model.\n",
        "-> Testing: Used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A Scikit-learn module that provides tools for scaling, encoding, and transforming data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A separate portion of the dataset used only for evaluating the trained model.\n",
        "\n",
        "11) How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Steps: Understand problem → Collect data → Clean data → EDA → Feature engineering → Model training → Evaluation → Deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> EDA helps understand data patterns, detect missing values, outliers, and relationships necessary for better model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Correlation measures the relationship and dependency between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> It means when one variable goes up, the other goes down.\n",
        "\n",
        "16) How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Using df.corr(), seaborn heatmap, or numpy.corrcoef().\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Causation means one variable directly affects another.\n",
        "Difference:\n",
        "Correlation ≠ Causation.\n",
        "Example: Ice cream sales and drowning cases are correlated, but ice cream does not cause drowning — hot weather causes both.\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "\n",
